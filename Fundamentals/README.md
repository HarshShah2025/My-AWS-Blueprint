# AWS Fundamentals

## 📦 What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is the process of **creating virtual machines (VMs)** that act like real computers, but run inside one physical machine using special software.

### 🔑 Benefits of Vm:
- We don't need new resources to use diffrent os 
- No risk of issue with primary os
- Isolation: Each VM runs independently
- Testing any app on different os


## ☁️ What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of IT services or resources like servers, storage, and databases via the internet, using a **pay-as-you-go** pricing.

### 🔑 Features:
- No need to buy/manage physical servers  
- Scalable & elastic 📈  
- Pay only for what you use 💰  
- High availability 🌍  
- Used via public cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP

## 🏢 Cloud Deployment Models

### 1. **Public Cloud**
- Fully owned by cloud providers (like AWS)
- Shared among multiple users (multi-tenant)
- e.g., AWS EC2, Lambda

### 2. **Private Cloud**
- Used by a single organization
- Hosted on-prem or by third-party
- More control and security

### 3. **Hybrid Cloud**
- Combines public + private
- Flexible, balanced model

## 🔧 Cloud Service Models

### 1. **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service)

   You manage everything except the hardware.  
   - **You handle**: OS, apps, security  
   - **AWS example**: EC2  
   - **Real-life**: Like renting an empty flat — you bring furniture.

---

### 2. **PaaS**  (Platform as a Service)  
   You focus on code, provider manages setup.  
   - **You handle**: App only  
   - **AWS example**: Elastic Beanstalk  
   - **Real-life**: Like a furnished apartment — just move in and live.

---

### 3. **SaaS** (Software as a Service)  
   Everything is managed — you just use it.  
   - **You handle**: Nothing  
   - **AWS example**: AWS WorkMail  
   - **Real-life**: Like staying in a hotel — everything is ready.
